The provided code does not contain any CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related vulnerabilities. 

The code is defining a class `TestConfigManagerConfig` that extends `ConfigManagerConfig` and overrides two methods: `getPollDuration()` and `isEnableCompareAndSwap()`. These methods return the value of the `period` variable and `enableCompareAndSwap` variable respectively.

However, without the implementation of the `ConfigManagerConfig` class, it is not possible to determine if there are any vulnerabilities specific to that class or if the overridden methods introduce any vulnerabilities.

To analyze for CWE or CVE vulnerabilities, it is necessary to review the implementation of the `ConfigManagerConfig` class and check for any potentially unsafe operations like input validation, insecure data storage, or potential code execution vulnerabilities.
