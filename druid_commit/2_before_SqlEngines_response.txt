The provided code does not contain any CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities.

However, it's worth noting that the code uses a custom exception class called `InvalidInput` which is not part of the standard Java exception hierarchy. If this class does not properly handle exceptions, it could potentially introduce vulnerabilities such as information leakage or improper exception handling.

To ensure the absence of vulnerabilities related to this custom exception class, it is necessary to review its implementation and usage throughout the codebase.
