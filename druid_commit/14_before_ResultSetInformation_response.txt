Based on the provided code, there are no obvious CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related vulnerabilities. The code appears to be a simple Java class representing ResultSet information. It includes getters, setters, constructors, and overridden methods for equality, hashCode, and toString.

However, it's important to note that the code alone does not provide enough context to determine if there are any vulnerabilities related to CWE or CVE. Vulnerabilities can exist in the code's usage or in the dependencies it relies on. It is always recommended to review the code in the context of its usage and look for potential issues such as input validation, output encoding, or vulnerabilities in the dependencies it relies on.
