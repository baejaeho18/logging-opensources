There do not appear to be any CWE or CVE-related vulnerabilities in the provided code. The code defines a Java class called `ResultSetInformation` that represents information about a result set from a SQL query. The class defines several properties, constructors, getters, and setters, and overrides the `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()` methods.

The code follows best practices for defining Java classes and does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities. However, it is important to note that code alone cannot guarantee the absence of vulnerabilities. The presence of security vulnerabilities also depends on how the code is used and integrated into a larger system.
