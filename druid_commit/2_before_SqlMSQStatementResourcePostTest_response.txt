The code provided appears to be a unit test rather than actual code that would be run in a production environment. As such, it is unlikely to contain any CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) vulnerabilities.

Since it is a unit test, the code should generally be focused on testing specific functionality rather than exposing potential vulnerabilities. However, it is always a good practice to review code for any security-related issues, regardless of its purpose.

In the provided code, there is no obvious vulnerability present that can be associated with a specific CWE or CVE. However, the overall security of the code and its dependencies should be assessed by conducting a comprehensive review and analysis of the entire application and its components.
