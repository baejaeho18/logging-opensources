The code does not contain any CWE or CVE-related vulnerabilities. However, there are a few points that could be improved:

1. Line 8: The correct way to specify license information is within the source code file, not in a comment block. It's recommended to remove this comment block and add the license information at the top of the file as a JavaDoc comment.

2. Line 10: The URL provided for the Apache License is outdated. It should be updated to "https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0".

3. Line 12: There is no need to have a static initialization block for initializing `NullHandling`. This can be moved to the constructor or a separate initialization method.

4. Line 28: The `getDouble()` method throws an `IllegalStateException` if the current value is null and SQL-compatible null handling is enabled. Instead of throwing an exception, it would be better to handle this case gracefully and return a meaningful value or indicate the null value in some way.

5. Line 34: The `isNull()` method returns true if `NullHandling.replaceWithDefault()` is false and the current value is null. It seems to contradict the intention of the `getDouble()` method and might be inconsistent. Consider reviewing the logic and ensuring consistency.

Overall, the code does not contain any known vulnerabilities, but it can benefit from some improvements in terms of clarity, documentation, and handling null values.
