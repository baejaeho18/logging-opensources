The provided code does not contain any CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related vulnerabilities. It consists of a class named `NilStorageConnector` that implements the `StorageConnector` interface. 

The purpose of the code is to act as a placeholder or null object when the actual storage connector is not configured. The methods in the class (`pathExists`, `read`, `readRange`, `write`, `deleteFile`, `deleteFiles`, `deleteRecursively`, `listDir`) throw a `DruidException` with an error message indicating that the durable storage is not configured.

The error handling mechanism seems appropriate, and there are no obvious security vulnerabilities in the code.
