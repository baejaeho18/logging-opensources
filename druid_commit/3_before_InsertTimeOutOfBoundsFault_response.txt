There doesn't appear to be any CWE or CVE related vulnerability in the code provided. The code is a simple Java class that extends `BaseMSQFault` and defines two fields - `interval` and `intervalBounds`. These fields are properly initialized in the constructor and annotated with `@JsonProperty` to indicate that they are serialized/deserialized from JSON.

The class also overrides methods such as `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()` to provide proper behavior for object comparison and string representation.

Overall, the code seems secure and doesn't exhibit any obvious vulnerabilities.
