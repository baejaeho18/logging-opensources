The code provided is for the Apache Druid RemoteTaskRunner. After running a security analysis, I found no specific CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities in the code. However, I noticed a general vulnerability related to the use of CuratorUtils to create ZK nodes. The usage of the `createIfNotExists` method does not handle KeeperException.NodeExistsException, which could lead to potential issues if the node already exists. You could address this by adding a try-catch block to handle the exception appropriately. Overall, I didn't find any other specific vulnerabilities in the code you provided.
