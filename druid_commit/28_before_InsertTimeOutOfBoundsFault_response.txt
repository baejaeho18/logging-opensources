There doesn't appear to be any CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities in this code. The code is a Java class that defines a fault object for when an insert time is out of bounds. It is for use in the Apache Druid project and is part of the error handling mechanism. The code defines the 'InsertTimeOutOfBoundsFault' class, which extends the 'BaseMSQFault' class. It has a constructor that takes an 'Interval' parameter to specify the time interval. The class also has getter methods for the interval and overrides the 'equals()' and 'hashCode()' methods for proper comparison and hashing. Overall, the code seems secure and does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities.
