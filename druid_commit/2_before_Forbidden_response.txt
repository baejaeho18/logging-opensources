The provided code does not have any specific CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. However, it is important to note that the code itself is incomplete and lacks the context required to fully determine its security posture. The code appears to be a custom exception class for handling forbidden access scenarios, but without the implementation details of the surrounding code, it is not possible to identify any specific vulnerabilities. It is important to ensure that proper access controls and validation are implemented in the calling code to prevent unauthorized access.
