The provided code appears to be a test code for a SQL statement resource. There doesn't seem to be any obvious CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related vulnerabilities in the code based on a quick review. However, it is important to note that vulnerabilities can exist in the code logic or in the dependencies used by the code, which requires further analysis and testing.

Without access to the dependencies and configuration files, it is not possible to fully evaluate the code for any possible vulnerabilities. Therefore, it is recommended to perform a detailed security analysis of the code, including a thorough review of the dependencies and their associated CVEs, to ensure the code is free from any vulnerabilities.
