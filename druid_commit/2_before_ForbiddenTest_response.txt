The provided code is a test class and does not contain any CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related vulnerabilities. It is purely a test case for the "testAsErrorResponse" method of the "ForbiddenTest" class.

The code creates an instance of the "ErrorResponse" class, sets the underlying exception to a new instance of "Forbidden.exception()", and then asserts that the generated map from the "ErrorResponse" object matches the expected values. It also checks that the recomposed "ErrorResponse" object has the same underlying exception.

There is no vulnerable code or security issues present in this code snippet.
